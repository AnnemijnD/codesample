This folder contains the projects of two courses I followed during my master's.
1. Bioinformatics in Translational Medicine
2. Datamining


## 1. Bioinformatics in Translational Medicine
During this project, we obtained the data of breast cancer patients and were asked
to create a model that would be able to classify the samples into different breast cancer subtypes.
This project investigated three feature selection methods and used a Support
Vector Machine as a classification method. To find the most optimal parameter set,
nested cross validation was implemented.

Ultimately, the best parameters for all three feature selection methods were found
and a confusion matrix was created using those parameters. The predicted class is shown on the X-axis
and on the Y-axis the true class can be observed.
